FUV as age indicator

sierchio_fuv.py:
Takes in Sierchio et al. 2014 catalog and uses astroquery to pull FUV magnitudes and errors from GALEX catlog. 

isaacson_fuv.py:
Takes in Isaacson an Fischer 2010 catalog and uses astroquery to pull FUV magnitudes and errors form GALEX. Note that it only pulls stars with HIP numbers. The rest I pulled seperately.
